# CPXradioactivesource
A mock radioactive source programmed with the half lives of 10 different isotopes. Flashes neopixels in random colours, 1 flash = 1 decay. 

Press button A to cycle through the sources. Press buttons a & b to begin decay. It will go on forever (or until there's an overflow). 

Fun and random thing I came up with in a physics lesson.
